## 1. Refactor `useStudySession` Hook with a State Machine

**(Corresponds to Section 3.1 of `codebase_analysis_and_recommendations.md`)**

*   **Problem Area Concisely:**
    *   File: `hooks/useStudySession.ts`.
    *   Issue: High complexity due to managing multiple session types (`learn-only`, `review-only`, `unified`), different phases within sessions (e.g., learning then review in 'unified'), extensive internal state (session queue, current card, results, UI flags), and orchestration of various helper modules (`card-state-handlers`, `session-queue-manager`) and actions (`studyQueryActions`, `cardActions`, `progressActions`).

*   **Specific, Actionable Steps for AI Agent:**

    1.  **Analyze `hooks/useStudySession.ts`**:
        *   Read `hooks/useStudySession.ts`, `lib/study/card-state-handlers.ts`, `lib/study/session-queue-manager.ts`, and relevant documentation (Project Docs: Sections 5.6.3, 6.1, 6.2).
        *   Identify all distinct operational states of a study session. Examples:
            *   `idle` (before session input is processed)
            *   `initializing` (session input received, parameters being set)
            *   `loadingCards` (fetching card IDs and card data)
            *   `cardReady` (card data loaded, ready to display question)
            *   `displayingQuestion`
            *   `displayingAnswer`
            *   `processingAnswer` (after user grades, before saving progress)
            *   `savingProgress`
            *   `determiningNextCard`
            *   `unifiedPhaseTransitionPrompt` (for 'unified' sessions, prompting to continue to review)
            *   `sessionComplete`
            *   `error` (e.g., if card loading fails)
        *   Identify all events/conditions that trigger transitions between these states (e.g., `SESSION_INPUT_RECEIVED`, `CARDS_FETCH_SUCCESS`, `CARDS_FETCH_ERROR`, `USER_FLIPPED_CARD`, `USER_SUBMITTED_ANSWER (grade)`, `PROGRESS_SAVE_SUCCESS`, `PROGRESS_SAVE_ERROR`, `ALL_LEARNING_CARDS_DONE`, `USER_CONTINUES_TO_REVIEW`, `NO_MORE_CARDS_IN_QUEUE`).

    2.  **Create `lib/study/studySessionMachine.ts`**:
        *   Define a state machine using a library like XState (preferred for robustness) or a `useReducer`-based structure if XState is not available/desired.
        *   The machine's `context` should hold: `sessionInput`, `sessionType`, `settings`, `sessionQueue`, `currentCardIndex`, `internalCardStates` (map of cardId to its session-specific state like streak/step), `sessionResults`, `errorDetails`, `unifiedSessionPhase` (`learning` | `review` | `na`).
        *   Implement states and transitions identified in step 1.

    3.  **Map State Machine Actions/Services**:
        *   **Services (for async operations):**
            *   `fetchCardData`: Calls `studyQueryActions.resolveStudyQuery` then `cardActions.getCardsByIds`. On success, updates machine context with card IDs and initializes `sessionQueue` via `sessionQueueManager.initializeQueue`.
            *   `saveCardProgress`: Calls `progressActions.updateCardProgress` with payload derived from `card-state-handlers.ts`.
        *   **Actions (for synchronous updates to machine context):**
            *   `updateCurrentCardState`: Modifies `internalCardStates` based on output from `card-state-handlers.ts`.
            *   `updateSessionQueue`: Uses `sessionQueueManager.updateQueueAfterAnswer`.
            *   `setNextCard`: Uses `sessionQueueManager.findNextCardIndex`.
            *   `incrementSessionResults`: Updates `sessionResults` based on grading.
            *   `setUnifiedPhase`: Changes `unifiedSessionPhase` in context.
        *   Logic from `lib/study/card-state-handlers.ts` will be invoked (likely synchronously) during an `ANSWER_SUBMITTED` event transition to determine the `CardStateUpdateOutcome`, which then informs context updates and the `saveCardProgress` service.

    4.  **Refactor `hooks/useStudySession.ts`**:
        *   Replace most internal `useState` and `useEffect` hooks with `useMachine` (from `@xstate/react`) or `useReducer`.
        *   Initialize the state machine with `initialInput` and `sessionType` passed as props (these will go into the machine's initial `context`).
        *   User interactions (e.g., grading a card) and completion of async operations (e.g., data fetching) will now `send` events to the state machine (e.g., `send({ type: 'USER_SUBMITTED_ANSWER', grade: 3 })`).
        *   The hook will derive its exposed state (e.g., `currentCardToDisplay`, `sessionStatusForUI`, `isLoading`, `error`) directly from the state machine's current `state.value` (the current state node) and `state.context`.

    5.  **Update Unit Tests**:
        *   Modify existing unit tests for `useStudySession.ts` to mock the state machine or to test interactions with it by sending events and asserting on the derived output.
        *   Create new unit tests specifically for `lib/study/studySessionMachine.ts`, testing its transitions, actions, and service invocations in isolation.

## 2. Refactor AI Generation Flow (`useAiGenerate` Hook) with `useReducer`

**(Corresponds to Section 3.2 of `codebase_analysis_and_recommendations.md`)**

*   **Problem Area Concisely:**
    *   File: `app/prepare/ai-generate/useAiGenerate.ts`.
    *   Issue: Manages complex state for a multi-step AI flashcard generation process (file uploads, multiple API calls per file for extraction, generation, classification, regeneration, and final saving). Numerous `useState` calls make state logic scattered and hard to follow.

*   **Specific, Actionable Steps for AI Agent:**

    1.  **Analyze `app/prepare/ai-generate/useAiGenerate.ts`**:
        *   Identify all existing `useState` variables and their update logic.
        *   Consolidate these into a single state object structure. This object should track an array or map of files, where each entry contains: `id` (client-generated), `fileObject`, `status` (enum: `idle`, `uploading`, `uploaded`, `extractingText`, `textExtracted`, `generatingInitialCards`, `initialCardsGenerated`, `classifyingCards`, `cardsClassified`, `regeneratingKnowledgeCards`, `knowledgeCardsRegenerated`, `error`, `savedToDeck`), `extractedText`, `generatedFlashcards`, `errorMessage`. Also include any global state like `isSavingDeck`.

    2.  **Define Reducer Actions**:
        *   Create a list of action types representing all possible state changes (e.g., `ADD_FILE`, `SET_FILE_STATUS`, `SET_EXTRACTED_TEXT`, `SET_GENERATED_CARDS`, `SET_FILE_ERROR`, `UPDATE_FLASHCARD_IN_FILE`, `REMOVE_FILE`, `SET_IS_SAVING_DECK`, `RESET_STATE`).

    3.  **Implement the Reducer Function**:
        *   In `useAiGenerate.ts` or a separate imported file, create the `aiGenerateReducer(state, action)` function.
        *   Use a `switch` statement for `action.type`.
        *   Ensure all state updates are immutable (create new state objects/arrays instead of modifying existing ones).

    4.  **Refactor `useAiGenerate.ts`**:
        *   Replace multiple `useState` calls with a single `useReducer` call: `const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(aiGenerateReducer, initialState);`.
        *   Convert existing state update logic to dispatch actions. For example, instead of `setIsLoading(true); setStatus('extracting')`, dispatch `dispatch({ type: 'SET_FILE_STATUS', payload: { fileId, status: 'extractingText' } })`.
        *   API call sequences (e.g., in `handleSubmit`, `handleConfirmTranslation`) will dispatch actions at the start of operations and in their `then/catch` blocks to update status, data, or errors.

    5.  **Update Associated Components**:
        *   Modify `AiGenerateInputCard.tsx`, `AiGenerateResultsCard.tsx`, and `AiGenerateSaveDeckCard.tsx` to consume state from the `state` object provided by the refactored `useAiGenerate` hook and to call functions from the hook that internally `dispatch` actions.

    6.  **Refactor `AiGenerateResultsCard.tsx` for Clarity**:
        *   Analyze the rendering logic within `AiGenerateResultsCard.tsx`.
        *   If it contains complex conditional rendering based on individual file/card states, break it down into smaller sub-components (e.g., `FileProcessingStatusItem.tsx`, `FlashcardReviewItem.tsx`, `GenerationErrorItem.tsx`).
        *   `AiGenerateResultsCard.tsx` will then map over `state.files` (from `useAiGenerate`) and render the appropriate sub-component for each file based on its status.

    7.  **Update Unit Tests**:
        *   Adapt existing tests for `useAiGenerate.ts` to work with the `dispatch` mechanism and the new state structure. Test individual action handlers in the reducer if possible.
        *   If new sub-components are created from `AiGenerateResultsCard.tsx`, create unit tests for them.

## 3. Address Prop Drilling in Deck Editing (`app/edit/[deckId]/`) with React Context

**(Corresponds to Section 3.3 of `codebase_analysis_and_recommendations.md`)**

*   **Problem Area Concisely:**
    *   Files: `app/edit/[deckId]/page.tsx`, `app/edit/[deckId]/useEditDeck.ts`, and sub-components like `DeckMetadataEditor.tsx`, `EditableCardTable.tsx`, `CardEditor.tsx` (if used).
    *   Issue: State and functions from `useEditDeck` (e.g., current deck data, card manipulation functions) are likely passed down through multiple intermediate components (prop drilling), making components less reusable and code harder to maintain.

*   **Specific, Actionable Steps for AI Agent:**

    1.  **Analyze Prop Drilling**:
        *   Read `app/edit/[deckId]/page.tsx` and its child components.
        *   Identify props passed down from `useEditDeck` through `page.tsx` to components like `EditableCardTable.tsx` and potentially further into a `CardEditor.tsx`. Focus on props used by deeply nested components but not their direct parents.

    2.  **Create `app/edit/[deckId]/DeckEditContext.tsx`**:
        *   Define a new React context.
        *   Specify a `DeckEditContextType` interface detailing the shape of the shared data (e.g., `deck: Deck | null`, `cards: Card[]`, `updateDeckMetadata: (data) => Promise<void>`, `addCard: (cardData) => Promise<void>`, `updateCard: (cardData) => Promise<void>`, `deleteCard: (cardId) => Promise<void>`, `isLoading: boolean`).

    3.  **Provide Context in `app/edit/[deckId]/page.tsx`**:
        *   Import `DeckEditContext`.
        *   In the `DeckEditPage` component, obtain the necessary data and functions from `useEditDeck.ts`.
        *   Wrap the main JSX of the page with `<DeckEditContext.Provider value={contextValue}>`, where `contextValue` is an object containing the shared data and functions.

    4.  **Consume Context in Child Components**:
        *   Modify components like `DeckMetadataEditor.tsx`, `EditableCardTable.tsx`, and any `CardEditor.tsx` to use `const context = useContext(DeckEditContext);`.
        *   Access shared data (e.g., `context.deck`) and functions (e.g., `context.updateCard`) directly from the context.
        *   Remove the corresponding props from these components' prop type definitions and their invocations.

    5.  **Update Unit Tests**:
        *   Adjust tests for components that now consume the context. This might involve wrapping them with the `DeckEditContext.Provider` in test setups, providing a mock context value.

## 4. Improve Data Fetching with TanStack Query (React Query)

**(Corresponds to Section 3.4 of `codebase_analysis_and_recommendations.md`)**

*   **Problem Area Concisely:**
    *   Files: Various custom data-fetching hooks (e.g., `hooks/useDecks.ts`, `hooks/useStudySets.ts`) and the components that use them.
    *   Issue: Manual management of data fetching state (loading, error, data), caching, and request de-duplication can lead to boilerplate, potential inconsistencies, and suboptimal performance.

*   **Specific, Actionable Steps for AI Agent (Incremental Adoption):**

    1.  **Install TanStack Query**:
        *   Execute `pnpm add @tanstack/react-query`.
        *   Optionally, `pnpm add @tanstack/react-query-devtools`.

    2.  **Set up `QueryClientProvider`**:
        *   Modify `app/layout.tsx` or `components/ClientProviders.tsx` to wrap the application with `<QueryClientProvider client={new QueryClient()}>`.
        *   Optionally include `<ReactQueryDevtools />`.

    3.  **Refactor `hooks/useDecks.ts` (Example Target Hook)**:
        *   Import `useQuery`, `useMutation`, `useQueryClient` from `@tanstack/react-query`.
        *   **For `getDecks`:**
            *   Replace existing state and effect logic with `useQuery({ queryKey: ['decks'], queryFn: () => deckActions.getDecks() })`.
        *   **For `getDeck(id)`:**
            *   Implement `useQuery({ queryKey: ['deck', deckId], queryFn: () => deckActions.getDeck(deckId), enabled: !!deckId })`.
        *   **For `createDeck`:**
            *   Implement `useMutation({ mutationFn: (data) => deckActions.createDeck(data), onSuccess: () => queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['decks'] }) })`.
        *   **For `updateDeck`:**
            *   Implement `useMutation({ mutationFn: (data) => deckActions.updateDeck(data), onSuccess: (updatedDeck) => { queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['decks'] }); queryClient.setQueryData(['deck', updatedDeck.id], updatedDeck); } })`.
        *   **For `deleteDeck`:**
            *   Implement `useMutation({ mutationFn: (id) => deckActions.deleteDeck(id), onSuccess: () => queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['decks'] }) })`.
        *   Expose the data, state flags (`isLoading`, `isError`), and mutation functions returned by TanStack Query hooks.

    4.  **Update Components Consuming `useDecks.ts`**:
        *   Adjust components (e.g., `DeckListClient.tsx`, `DeckTableClient.tsx`) to use the new interface of `useDecks.ts` (e.g., `data.decks` instead of `decks`, `isLoading` instead of `isLoadingDecks`).

    5.  **Update Unit Tests**:
        *   Tests for `useDecks.ts` will need to mock TanStack Query's hooks or provide a `QueryClientProvider` in the test setup.
        *   Component tests might need to account for new loading/error states.

    6.  **Incrementally Apply to Other Hooks**:
        *   Repeat steps 3-5 for other data-fetching hooks like `hooks/useStudySets.ts`, `hooks/useTags.ts`, etc.

## 5. Simplify Complex Conditional Rendering in `StudyFlashcardView.tsx`

**(Corresponds to Section 3.5 of `codebase_analysis_and_recommendations.md`)**

*   **Problem Area Concisely:**
    *   File: `components/study/StudyFlashcardView.tsx`.
    *   Issue: Complex inline logic to determine and display card status information (e.g., streak, learning step, due status) based on card state and study settings, cluttering the component.

*   **Specific, Actionable Steps for AI Agent:**

    1.  **Analyze `components/study/StudyFlashcardView.tsx`**:
        *   Locate the JSX and JavaScript logic responsible for rendering the card's dynamic status text.
        *   Identify all input variables needed for this logic (e.g., `currentCard` object, `userSettings` object).

    2.  **Create `lib/study/studyUiFormatters.ts` (or similar utility file)**:
        *   Define a pure function, e.g., `formatCardDisplayStatus(card: SessionCard, settings: UserSettings): { text: string; details?: string; colorScheme?: string; }`.
        *   Move all conditional logic for determining the status string and any associated display hints (like color or icon identifiers) into this function.
        *   Ensure the function is pure and returns a structured object.

    3.  **Create `components/study/CardStatusIndicator.tsx`**:
        *   This new presentational component will take `card: SessionCard` and `settings: UserSettings` as props.
        *   It will call `formatCardDisplayStatus(card, settings)`.
        *   It will render the `text` and `details` from the returned object, applying any `colorScheme` or other display hints.

    4.  **Refactor `components/study/StudyFlashcardView.tsx`**:
        *   Remove the inline status calculation logic.
        *   Import and use the new `CardStatusIndicator` component, passing the `currentCard` and `userSettings` props to it.

    5.  **Update Unit Tests**:
        *   Create unit tests for the new `formatCardDisplayStatus` function, covering various card states and settings.
        *   Create unit tests for `CardStatusIndicator.tsx` to ensure it renders correctly based on props.
        *   Adjust tests for `StudyFlashcardView.tsx` to mock or verify the props passed to `CardStatusIndicator`.

## 6. Clarify Coupling between API Routes and Server Actions for Deck Creation

**(Corresponds to Section 3.6 of `codebase_analysis_and_recommendations.md`)**

*   **Problem Area Concisely:**
    *   Files: `app/api/decks/route.ts` and `lib/actions/deckActions.ts`.
    *   Issue: `POST /api/decks/route.ts` is documented to handle manual deck creation by internally calling the `deckActions.createDeck` Server Action. This creates an extra layer that might be redundant for manual creation if the API route adds no significant unique logic for this specific path.

*   **Specific, Actionable Steps for AI Agent:**

    1.  **Analyze `app/api/decks/route.ts` (specifically the POST handler for manual creation)**:
        *   Determine if the route handler, for the manual deck creation path, applies any unique logic (e.g., specific authentication checks different from Server Actions, complex request transformations, unique middleware) *before* calling `deckActions.createDeck`.

    2.  **If the API Route wrapper for manual creation is "thin" (adds no significant unique logic):**
        *   **Identify Client Caller:** Locate the client-side code (e.g., in `app/decks/new/page.tsx` or a component/hook it uses) that makes the `fetch` call to `POST /api/decks` for manual deck creation.
        *   **Modify Client Caller:** Change this client-side code to directly import and `await deckActions.createDeck(deckData)` instead of using `fetch`.
        *   **Update API Route (Optional):** If the manual creation path is removed from the API route, simplify the route handler to only manage AI deck creation (which has different payload requirements, like including card lists). Add comments clarifying its specific purpose for AI-generated decks.

    3.  **If the API Route wrapper for manual creation is "essential" (adds unique, necessary logic):**
        *   **Add Explanatory Comments:** In `app/api/decks/route.ts`, within the `POST` handler, add detailed comments explaining *why* this API route is used as a wrapper for the `deckActions.createDeck` Server Action specifically for the manual creation flow. This comment should clarify the unique value provided by the API route in this context.

    4.  **Update Documentation (if necessary)**:
        *   Ensure `docs/project-documentation v4.md` accurately reflects the finalized deck creation flow (whether it's direct Server Action call or via API Route for manual creation, and why).

    5.  **Update Unit/Integration Tests**:
        *   If the client-side invocation changes, update relevant tests to reflect direct Server Action usage.
        *   Ensure API route tests (if any) are still valid for its remaining responsibilities (e.g., AI deck creation).
