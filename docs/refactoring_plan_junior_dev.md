## 1. Refactoring `useStudySession` Hook with a State Machine

**(Based on Section 3.1 of `codebase_analysis_and_recommendations.md`)**

### 1.1. Explain the Problem Simply

*   **What is the issue?**
    *   The `useStudySession` hook is like the main brain for when you're actually studying cards. It keeps track of *everything*: which card you're seeing, what happens when you answer, saving your progress, and even switching between learning new cards and reviewing old ones in "unified" mode.
    *   When we say it's "too complex," it means this one piece of code is juggling too many tasks and decisions at once.

*   **Why is this a problem?**
    *   **Hard to Understand:** When a lot of logic is packed into one place, it's like trying to read a map where all the roads are tangled together. It's tough for anyone (especially if you're new to this part of the code) to figure out exactly how it works.
    *   **Easy to Introduce Bugs:** When you try to change something or add a new feature, it's easy to accidentally break something else because so many parts are connected.
    *   **Difficult to Change or Add Features:** Making improvements or adding new study options becomes slow and risky.

### 1.2. Explain the Solution and Core Concepts

*   **What is the suggested way to fix it?**
    *   We suggest using a **State Machine**.

*   **Core Concepts: State Machine**
    *   **What is it?** A state machine is a way to describe how something should behave based on its current "state" and any "events" that happen. Think of it like a board game:
        *   **States:** These are the different situations or conditions the system can be in (e.g., `Loading Cards`, `Showing Question`, `Showing Answer`, `Saving Progress`, `Session Over`). At any given time, the machine is in only *one* of these states.
        *   **Events:** These are things that happen that can cause the system to change its state (e.g., `CARDS_LOADED`, `USER_FLIPPED_CARD`, `USER_ANSWERED_GOOD`, `SAVE_COMPLETED`).
        *   **Transitions:** These are the rules that say, "If you are in *this state* and *this event* happens, then you should move to *that new state*." (e.g., If in `Showing Question` state and `USER_FLIPPED_CARD` event occurs, transition to `Showing Answer` state).
        *   **(Optional) Actions/Services:** When a transition happens, or when entering/leaving a state, you can also perform actions (e.g., save data to the database, fetch new cards).

    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Manages Complexity:** It breaks down complex logic into smaller, understandable pieces (states and transitions).
        *   **Predictable States:** You always know what state the system is in and how it got there. This makes debugging much easier.
        *   **Clear Flow:** The possible paths through the logic are clearly defined.

    *   **Recommended Option:** While you could build a simple state machine with `useReducer`, for something as central as `useStudySession`, using a dedicated library like **XState** is recommended. XState is powerful, helps visualize state machines, and handles more complex scenarios well.

### 1.3. Provide a Step-by-Step Approach (using XState)

1.  **Learn XState Basics:**
    *   Go through the XState documentation (see references) to understand its core concepts: `createMachine`, `states`, `on` (for events/transitions), `actions` (for side effects), `services` (for async operations).

2.  **Identify States and Events for `useStudySession`:**
    *   Read through `hooks/useStudySession.ts` and the documentation (Sections 6.1, 5.6.3, 5.6.5 of the main project docs) to list all the different phases and actions of a study session.
    *   Example States: `initializing`, `loadingCards`, `displayingCard_question`, `displayingCard_answer`, `processingAnswer`, `persistingProgress`, `handlingUnifiedSessionTransition`, `sessionComplete`, `errorState`.
    *   Example Events: `FETCH_CARDS`, `CARDS_LOADED_SUCCESS`, `CARDS_LOADED_ERROR`, `FLIP_CARD`, `ANSWER_SUBMITTED (with grade)`, `PROGRESS_SAVED_SUCCESS`, `PROGRESS_SAVED_ERROR`, `CONTINUE_TO_REVIEW_PHASE`, `FINISH_SESSION`.

3.  **Create the State Machine Definition:**
    *   Create a new file, e.g., `lib/study/studySessionMachine.ts`.
    *   Use `createMachine` from XState to define your states, events, and transitions.
    *   Define `actions` (e.g., updating internal machine context) and `services` (e.g., functions that call your existing server actions like `progressActions.updateCardProgress` or card fetching logic).

    ```typescript
    // Example (very simplified) in lib/study/studySessionMachine.ts
    import { createMachine, assign } from 'xstate';
    import { fetchCardsForSession, persistProgress } from './studyMachineServices'; // You'll create these

    export const studySessionMachine = createMachine({
      id: 'studySession',
      initial: 'initializing',
      context: { // Like useState, but for the whole machine
        currentCardIndex: 0,
        sessionQueue: [],
        error: null,
        // ... other needed data
      },
      states: {
        initializing: {
          on: { FETCH_CARDS: 'loadingCards' }
        },
        loadingCards: {
          invoke: {
            src: fetchCardsForSession, // This service would call your card fetching actions
            onDone: {
              target: 'displayingCard_question',
              actions: assign({ sessionQueue: (context, event) => event.data }) // Save fetched cards
            },
            onError: {
              target: 'errorState',
              actions: assign({ error: (context, event) => event.data })
            }
          }
        },
        displayingCard_question: {
          on: { FLIP_CARD: 'displayingCard_answer' /* ... more events */ }
        },
        displayingCard_answer: {
          on: { ANSWER_SUBMITTED: 'processingAnswer' }
        },
        processingAnswer: {
          // ... logic to call card-state-handlers, then invoke persistProgress service
        },
        // ... other states: persistingProgress, handlingUnifiedSessionTransition, sessionComplete, errorState
      }
    });
    ```

4.  **Refactor `useStudySession.ts`:**
    *   Import your `studySessionMachine`.
    *   Use the `useMachine` hook from `@xstate/react`.
        ```typescript
        import { useMachine } from '@xstate/react';
        import { studySessionMachine } from './lib/study/studySessionMachine'; // Adjust path

        export function useStudySession(initialInput, sessionType) {
          const [state, send] = useMachine(studySessionMachine, {
            // You can pass initial context or services here if needed
            // services: { /* override services if necessary */ }
          });

          // `state` object contains current state value, context, etc.
          // `send` function is used to send events to the machine, e.g., send({ type: 'FLIP_CARD' })

          // Expose necessary data and functions derived from `state` and `send`
          return {
            currentCard: state.context.sessionQueue[state.context.currentCardIndex],
            currentStateValue: state.value, // e.g., 'displayingCard_question'
            isLoading: state.matches('loadingCards'),
            flipCard: () => send({ type: 'FLIP_CARD' }),
            submitAnswer: (grade) => send({ type: 'ANSWER_SUBMITTED', grade: grade }),
            // ... other functions and data for the UI
          };
        }
        ```
    *   Remove old `useState` and `useEffect` calls that are now managed by the state machine. For example, data fetching logic moves into services invoked by the machine. UI state updates are driven by changes in the machine's state.

5.  **Create Service Functions:**
    *   Functions that were previously called directly in `useEffect` or event handlers (like fetching cards, saving progress) will now be "services" invoked by the machine.
    *   These service functions will typically return Promises.
    *   Example: `lib/study/studyMachineServices.ts`
        ```typescript
        // Example service
        export const fetchCardsForSession = async (context, event) => {
          // ... use context.initialInput and context.sessionType
          // ... call resolveStudyQuery action, then getCardsByIds action
          // return the cards array or throw an error
        };

        export const persistProgress = async (context, event) => {
          // ... call progressActions.updateCardProgress with relevant data from context/event
        };
        ```

6.  **Test Thoroughly:** Test all session types and user interactions.

## 2. Refactoring AI Generation Flow (`useAiGenerate` Hook) with `useReducer`

**(Based on Section 3.2 of `codebase_analysis_and_recommendations.md`)**

### 2.1. Explain the Problem Simply

*   **What is the issue?**
    *   The `useAiGenerate` hook manages the process of creating flashcards using AI. This is a multi-step process: you upload a file, the AI processes it, you might review and ask for changes, and then you save it.
    *   The hook needs to keep track of the status of each file (Is it uploading? Is AI working on it? Did an error occur?), the text extracted, the flashcards generated, etc.
    *   Using many separate `useState` calls for all these pieces of information can make the hook complicated.

*   **Why is this a problem?**
    *   **Scattered State Logic:** When state updates are spread across many `useState` calls and event handlers, it's hard to see the big picture of how the state changes.
    *   **Complex Updates:** If updating one piece of state means you also need to update another (e.g., setting an error message also means changing status to 'error'), it's easy to miss a step.
    *   **Harder to Debug:** Tracing how and why a particular state got its value can be tricky.

### 2.2. Explain the Solution and Core Concepts

*   **What is the suggested way to fix it?**
    *   We suggest using the `useReducer` hook to manage the complex state within `useAiGenerate`.

*   **Core Concepts: `useReducer`**
    *   **What is it?** `useReducer` is a React hook that's an alternative to `useState`. It's generally preferred for managing state that has multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one in a more complex way.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   **State:** A single object that holds all your related pieces of information (e.g., `{ files: [...], currentFileStatus: 'idle', errorMessage: null }`).
        *   **Actions:** Objects that describe *what happened* or what state change is requested (e.g., `{ type: 'FILE_UPLOAD_START', payload: file }` or `{ type: 'GENERATION_SUCCESS', payload: { fileId: '123', cards: [...] } }`).
        *   **Reducer Function:** This is a pure function you write. It takes the current `state` and an `action` object as input, and it returns the *new* state. It determines how the state should change in response to an action. It often uses a `switch` statement to handle different action types.
            ```javascript
            function myReducer(state, action) {
              switch (action.type) {
                case 'FILE_UPLOAD_START':
                  // return new state with file added and status updated
                case 'GENERATION_SUCCESS':
                  // return new state with cards added for that file and status updated
                default:
                  return state;
              }
            }
            ```
        *   **Dispatch:** `useReducer` gives you a `dispatch` function. Instead of calling `setState`, you call `dispatch(actionObject)` to trigger a state update. React then calls your reducer function with the current state and that action.

    *   **`useReducer` vs. `useState`:**
        *   `useState` is great for simple, independent pieces of state (like a boolean toggle or a single input field's value).
        *   `useReducer` shines when:
            *   You have a complex state object with multiple related fields.
            *   The logic for updating the state is complex and involves multiple steps or depends on the previous state.
            *   You want to co-locate all the state update logic in one place (the reducer function). This often makes it easier to test.

### 2.3. Provide a Step-by-Step Approach

1.  **Identify All Pieces of State:**
    *   Look at `app/prepare/ai-generate/useAiGenerate.ts` and list all the `useState` calls.
    *   Think about all the information needed to track the AI generation process for one or more files (e.g., file objects, status per file, extracted text per file, generated cards per file, overall loading/error states).

2.  **Define the State Shape:**
    *   Design a single object structure that can hold all this information. It might be an object where keys are file IDs (or temporary client-side IDs), and values are objects containing details for that file:
        ```typescript
        // Example initial state structure
        const initialState = {
          files: { // Using an object for easy lookup by ID
            // 'file-id-1': {
            //   fileObject: null, // The actual File object
            //   status: 'idle', // e.g., 'idle', 'uploading', 'extracting', 'generating', 'review', 'error'
            //   extractedText: null,
            //   generatedCards: [],
            //   errorMessage: null
            // },
          },
          isProcessingOverall: false, // For global loading indicators
        };
        ```

3.  **Define Action Types:**
    *   List all the different events or operations that can change the state. These will become your action types.
    *   Examples: `ADD_FILE`, `UPLOAD_PROGRESS`, `EXTRACTION_START`, `EXTRACTION_SUCCESS`, `EXTRACTION_FAILURE`, `INITIAL_GENERATION_START`, `INITIAL_GENERATION_SUCCESS`, `INITIAL_GENERATION_FAILURE`, `SAVE_DECK_START`, `SAVE_DECK_SUCCESS`, `SAVE_DECK_FAILURE`, `UPDATE_CARD`, `SET_ERROR_MESSAGE_FILE`.

4.  **Write the Reducer Function:**
    *   Create a new function (e.g., `aiGenerateReducer`) outside your hook. It takes `(state, action)` as arguments.
    *   Use a `switch (action.type)` statement to handle each action type.
    *   For each case, return a *new* state object with the necessary updates. **Important: State updates must be immutable.** Always create a new object/array instead of modifying the existing one directly. Use spread syntax (`...`) for this.

    ```typescript
    // Example reducer structure
    function aiGenerateReducer(state, action) {
      switch (action.type) {
        case 'ADD_FILE':
          return {
            ...state,
            files: {
              ...state.files,
              [action.payload.id]: { // action.payload contains file and a generated ID
                fileObject: action.payload.file,
                status: 'pending_upload',
                // ... other initial fields
              }
            }
          };
        case 'EXTRACTION_SUCCESS': // action.payload = { fileId: '...', text: '...' }
          return {
            ...state,
            files: {
              ...state.files,
              [action.payload.fileId]: {
                ...state.files[action.payload.fileId],
                status: 'extracted',
                extractedText: action.payload.text,
              }
            }
          };
        // ... other cases
        default:
          throw new Error(`Unhandled action type: ${action.type}`);
      }
    }
    ```

5.  **Refactor `useAiGenerate.ts`:**
    *   Import `useReducer`.
    *   Call `useReducer` with your reducer function and initial state:
        ```typescript
        const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(aiGenerateReducer, initialState);
        ```
    *   Replace `useState` calls with values from the `state` object (e.g., `state.files`, `state.isProcessingOverall`).
    *   Replace direct state update calls (e.g., `setIsLoading(true)`) with `dispatch` calls:
        *   `setIsLoading(true)` becomes `dispatch({ type: 'OVERALL_PROCESSING_START' })`.
        *   When a file is added: `dispatch({ type: 'ADD_FILE', payload: { id: clientFileId, file: newFile } })`.
    *   All asynchronous operations (API calls) will still be part of your hook, but when they complete (or fail), they will `dispatch` actions to update the state managed by the reducer.

6.  **Update Components:**
    *   Ensure components like `AiGenerateInputCard.tsx` and `AiGenerateResultsCard.tsx` correctly use the state and dispatch functions provided by the refactored `useAiGenerate` hook.

## 3. Addressing Prop Drilling in Deck Editing (`app/edit/[deckId]/`) with React Context

**(Based on Section 3.3 of `codebase_analysis_and_recommendations.md`)**

### 3.1. Explain the Problem Simply

*   **What is the issue? (Prop Drilling)**
    *   Imagine you have a piece of information (like the current deck's name) or a function (like `saveCardChanges`) that's needed by a component deep inside many other components.
    *   "Prop drilling" is when you have to pass this information (prop) down through every intermediate component, even if those components don't use it themselves. It's like passing a message through a long line of people.

    ```
    // Page Component (has deck data and saveCard function)
    //   DeckEditorLayout (doesn't need saveCard, but passes it)
    //     EditableCardTable (doesn't need saveCard, but passes it)
    //       CardRow (doesn't need saveCard, but passes it)
    //         EditCardForm (FINALLY uses saveCard!)
    ```

*   **Why is this a problem?**
    *   **Makes Code Verbose:** Components have props they don't care about.
    *   **Hard to Refactor:** If you change how or where a prop is passed, you might have to update many files.
    *   **Less Reusable Components:** Intermediate components become tied to the props they pass, even if they don't use them.

### 3.2. Explain the Solution and Core Concepts

*   **What is the suggested way to fix it?**
    *   Use **React Context** to make data and functions available to any component in a certain part of your component tree, without manually passing props down.

*   **Core Concepts: React Context**
    *   **What is it?** React Context provides a way to share values (like state or functions) between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.
    *   **How it works:**
        1.  **Create Context:** You first create a Context object using `React.createContext()`.
            ```javascript
            // Example: DeckEditContext.js
            import React from 'react';
            const DeckEditContext = React.createContext(null); // Can pass a default value
            export default DeckEditContext;
            ```
        2.  **Provide Context:** Higher up in your component tree (e.g., in `app/edit/[deckId]/page.tsx`), you use a "Provider" component. This Provider wraps the part of your tree that needs access to the context data. It takes a `value` prop, which is the data you want to share.
            ```javascript
            // In app/edit/[deckId]/page.tsx
            import DeckEditContext from './DeckEditContext'; // Adjust path
            // ... (import useEditDeck hook)

            function DeckEditPage() {
              const { deckData, saveCard, deleteCard /* ... other values from useEditDeck */ } = useEditDeck();
              
              const contextValue = { deckData, saveCard, deleteCard /* ... */ };

              return (
                <DeckEditContext.Provider value={contextValue}>
                  {/* Rest of your deck editing UI: DeckMetadataEditor, EditableCardTable, etc. */}
                </DeckEditContext.Provider>
              );
            }
            ```
        3.  **Consume Context:** Any child component (no matter how deeply nested) can then "consume" (read) this data using the `useContext` hook.
            ```javascript
            // Example: In EditCardForm.js (deep inside the tree)
            import React, { useContext } from 'react';
            import DeckEditContext from './DeckEditContext'; // Adjust path

            function EditCardForm({ card }) {
              const { deckData, saveCard } = useContext(DeckEditContext);
              // Now you can use deckData or call saveCard() without them being passed as props!
              
              const handleSave = () => {
                // ...
                saveCard(updatedCardData);
              };
              // ...
            }
            ```

    *   **Benefits:**
        *   Avoids prop drilling.
        *   Makes data globally available within a specific part of your app.
        *   Keeps intermediate components cleaner.

### 3.3. Provide a Step-by-Step Approach

1.  **Identify Data/Functions Being Drilled:**
    *   Examine `app/edit/[deckId]/page.tsx`, `useEditDeck.ts`, and its child components (`DeckMetadataEditor.tsx`, `EditableCardTable.tsx`, any `CardEditor.tsx`).
    *   Look for props that are passed down multiple levels but not used by the intermediate components. Common candidates are deck data, functions to update cards/deck, and state related to which card is being edited.

2.  **Create the Context File:**
    *   Create a new file, e.g., `app/edit/[deckId]/DeckEditContext.tsx`.
    *   Inside, use `React.createContext(null)` to create and export your context.
        ```typescript
        // app/edit/[deckId]/DeckEditContext.tsx
        import React from 'react';

        // Define a shape for your context value for better TypeScript support (optional but good)
        // interface DeckEditContextType {
        //   deckData: any; // Replace 'any' with your Deck type
        //   saveCard: (cardData: any) => void; // Replace 'any'
        //   deleteCard: (cardId: string) => void;
        //   // ... other shared values/functions
        // }

        const DeckEditContext = React.createContext</*DeckEditContextType |*/ null>(null);
        export default DeckEditContext;
        ```

3.  **Provide the Context Value:**
    *   In `app/edit/[deckId]/page.tsx` (or a similar top-level component for the deck editing feature):
        *   Import your `DeckEditContext`.
        *   Get the data and functions from `useEditDeck.ts`.
        *   Create an object containing all the values you want to share.
        *   Wrap the relevant part of your JSX with `<DeckEditContext.Provider value={yourContextValueObject}>`.

4.  **Consume the Context in Child Components:**
    *   In any child component that needs the shared data/functions (e.g., `EditableCardTable.tsx`, `CardEditor.tsx`, `DeckMetadataEditor.tsx`):
        *   Import `useContext` from `react` and your `DeckEditContext`.
        *   Call `const contextValue = useContext(DeckEditContext);`.
        *   Access the data/functions from `contextValue` (e.g., `contextValue.deckData`, `contextValue.saveCard`).
        *   Remove the props that are now supplied by the context from these child components' prop declarations.

5.  **Refactor Intermediate Components:**
    *   Remove the drilled props from components that were only passing them through. They no longer need to declare or forward these props.

6.  **Test:** Ensure all functionality related to deck editing still works correctly.

## 4. Improving Data Fetching with TanStack Query (React Query)

**(Based on Section 3.4 of `codebase_analysis_and_recommendations.md`)**

### 4.1. Explain the Problem Simply

*   **What is the issue?**
    *   Our application often needs to get data from the server (e.g., list of decks, details of a specific deck). We use custom hooks (like `useDecks`) and Server Actions for this.
    *   Managing things like loading states (showing a spinner), error states (showing an error message), caching data (so we don't fetch the same thing over and over), and keeping data fresh can involve writing a lot of similar (boilerplate) code in each hook.

*   **Why is this a problem?**
    *   **Repetitive Code:** We might be writing the same logic for loading/error/caching in many places.
    *   **Manual Caching:** Handling caching manually can be complex and error-prone. For instance, how do we know when cached data is "stale" (out of date) and needs to be fetched again?
    *   **UI Consistency:** It can be harder to ensure a consistent user experience for data fetching across the app.

### 4.2. Explain the Solution and Core Concepts

*   **What is the suggested way to fix it?**
    *   Incrementally adopt **TanStack Query (formerly React Query)** for data fetching.

*   **Core Concepts: TanStack Query**
    *   **What is it?** TanStack Query is a powerful library for fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating server state in React applications. It doesn't fetch data itself but helps you manage the data you get from your Server Actions or API calls.
    *   **Key Features & Concepts:**
        *   **Queries (`useQuery`):** Used for fetching data (Read operations).
            *   You give it a unique `queryKey` (like a name for this piece of data, e.g., `['decks']` or `['deck', deckId]`).
            *   You provide a `queryFn` (an async function that fetches your data – this would typically call your existing Server Action).
            *   It automatically gives you:
                *   `data`: The fetched data.
                *   `isLoading`: True if it's currently fetching for the first time.
                *   `isFetching`: True if it's fetching in the background (e.g., refetching).
                *   `isError`: True if an error occurred.
                *   `error`: The error object.
        *   **Mutations (`useMutation`):** Used for creating, updating, or deleting data (Write operations).
            *   You provide a `mutationFn` (an async function that performs the change – this would call your Server Action for creating/updating/deleting).
            *   It gives you a `mutate` function to trigger the operation.
            *   You can configure it to automatically refetch queries (e.g., refetch the list of decks after a new deck is created) or update the cache optimistically.
        *   **Caching:** TanStack Query automatically caches query data. If you ask for data with the same `queryKey` again, it will often return the cached data immediately while potentially refetching in the background to keep it fresh.
        *   **Stale-While-Revalidate:** This is a common caching strategy. TanStack Query can show you "stale" (old) data from the cache right away (making your app feel fast) while it fetches fresh data in the background. Once the fresh data arrives, your UI updates.
        *   **Devtools:** Provides excellent developer tools to see what's in the cache and how queries are behaving.

    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Reduces Boilerplate:** Handles loading, error, and caching logic for you.
        *   **Improved Performance & UX:** Smart caching and background updates make the app feel faster and more responsive.
        *   **Automatic Refetching:** Can automatically refetch data when the window is refocused or the network reconnects.
        *   **Declarative Approach:** You declare what data you need, and TanStack Query manages how to get it and keep it updated.

### 4.3. Provide a Step-by-Step Approach (Incremental Adoption)

1.  **Install TanStack Query:**
    *   Run `pnpm add @tanstack/react-query`.
    *   (Optional but recommended) `pnpm add @tanstack/react-query-devtools`.

2.  **Set up `QueryClientProvider`:**
    *   In your main layout file (`app/layout.tsx` or `components/ClientProviders.tsx`), you need to wrap your application (or the part of it that will use TanStack Query) with `QueryClientProvider`.
    ```typescript
    // In app/layout.tsx or components/ClientProviders.tsx
    'use client'; // If this is a client component wrapper

    import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
    import { ReactQueryDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-query-devtools'; // Optional
    import React from 'react';

    // Create a client
    const queryClient = new QueryClient();

    export function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) { // Or your existing ClientProviders
      return (
        <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
          {children}
          <ReactQueryDevtools initialIsOpen={false} /> {/* Optional Devtools */}
        </QueryClientProvider>
      );
    }
    ```

3.  **Pick One Custom Hook to Refactor (e.g., `hooks/useDecks.ts`):**
    *   Start small. Let's say `useDecks.ts` currently fetches all decks.

4.  **Refactor the Hook to Use `useQuery`:**
    *   Read the existing `useDecks.ts` and the Server Action it calls (e.g., `deckActions.getDecks`).
    *   Modify `useDecks.ts`:
    ```typescript
    // hooks/useDecks.ts
    import { useQuery, useMutation, useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';
    import { getDecks, createDeck, deleteDeck /* ... other deckActions */ } from '@/lib/actions/deckActions'; // Adjust path

    export function useDecks() {
      const queryClient = useQueryClient(); // For invalidating cache after mutations

      // For fetching all decks
      const { data: decks, isLoading, isError, error } = useQuery({
        queryKey: ['decks'], // Unique key for this query
        queryFn: async () => getDecks(), // This calls your Server Action
        // You can add more options like staleTime, cacheTime if needed
      });

      // For creating a deck (example mutation)
      const { mutate: createNewDeck, isLoading: isCreatingDeck } = useMutation({
        mutationFn: async (newDeckData) => createDeck(newDeckData), // Calls Server Action
        onSuccess: () => {
          // When creation is successful, invalidate the 'decks' query to refetch the list
          queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['decks'] });
        },
        // onError: (error) => { /* Handle error */ }
      });
      
      // For deleting a deck (example mutation)
      const { mutate: removeDeck, isLoading: isDeletingDeck } = useMutation({
        mutationFn: async (deckId: string) => deleteDeck(deckId),
        onSuccess: () => {
          queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['decks'] });
        },
      });

      return {
        decks,
        isLoadingDecks: isLoading,
        isErrorDecks: isError,
        errorDecks: error,
        createNewDeck,
        isCreatingDeck,
        removeDeck,
        isDeletingDeck,
        // ... expose other mutations for update, getDeck by ID (which would be another useQuery)
      };
    }
    ```

5.  **Update Components:**
    *   Components that were using the old `useDecks` hook will now get data and state like `decks`, `isLoadingDecks`, `createNewDeck` from the refactored hook. Adjust them as needed.

6.  **Test:** Verify that fetching, creating, and deleting decks still work correctly. Use the React Query Devtools to inspect query states and cache.

7.  **Iterate:** Gradually refactor other data-fetching hooks (`useStudySets`, parts of `useEditDeck` for fetching initial data, etc.) following the same pattern.

## 5. Simplifying Complex Conditional Rendering in `StudyFlashcardView.tsx`

**(Based on Section 3.5 of `codebase_analysis_and_recommendations.md`)**

### 5.1. Explain the Problem Simply

*   **What is the issue?**
    *   The `StudyFlashcardView.tsx` component shows the flashcard you're currently studying. It also displays status information like "Streak: 2/3", "Learning: Step 1/2", or "Review Due Soon!".
    *   Figuring out *exactly* what status text to show, and maybe how to style it (e.g., different colors), can involve a lot of `if/else` conditions directly within the component that renders the card. This makes the main view component cluttered.

*   **Why is this a problem?**
    *   **Cluttered Component:** The `StudyFlashcardView` component becomes harder to read because display logic is mixed with status calculation logic.
    *   **Hard to Change Status Display:** If you want to change how statuses are displayed (e.g., add icons, change wording), you have to dig through the main component's rendering logic.
    *   **Logic Not Reusable:** If you needed to show a similar status somewhere else, you'd have to copy-paste the logic.

### 5.2. Explain the Solution and Core Concepts

*   **What is the suggested way to fix it?**
    1.  **Extract Logic to a Pure Function:** Create a separate helper function that takes the card's data and user settings and returns the formatted status information (text, style hints, etc.).
    2.  **Create a Dedicated Display Component:** Create a small, simple component whose only job is to take this formatted status information and display it.

*   **Core Concepts:**
    *   **Pure Functions:**
        *   A pure function is a function that, given the same inputs, will always return the same output and has no "side effects" (it doesn't change anything outside of itself, like global variables or making API calls).
        *   Benefits: They are predictable, easy to test, and don't interfere with other parts of your application. Our status formatting function will be pure.
    *   **Single Responsibility Principle (for Components):**
        *   This principle states that a component (or function, or class) should have only one reason to change. In other words, it should do one thing and do it well.
        *   Our `StudyFlashcardView` should be responsible for the overall layout and interaction of the flashcard. The new `CardStatusIndicator` component will be solely responsible for displaying the card's status.

### 5.3. Provide a Step-by-Step Approach

1.  **Analyze Existing Status Logic:**
    *   Look inside `components/study/StudyFlashcardView.tsx`. Find the part of the JSX (render method) where it calculates and displays the card's status text (streak, learning step, due status, etc.).
    *   Note all the variables it uses to make these decisions (e.g., `card.srs_level`, `card.learning_state`, `card.internalState.streak`, `settings.studyAlgorithm`).

2.  **Create the Pure Formatting Function:**
    *   Create a new file, e.g., `lib/study/studyUiFormatters.ts` (or add to an existing UI helper file).
    *   Define a function, for example:
        ```typescript
        // lib/study/studyUiFormatters.ts
        // You'll need to import your SessionCard and UserSettings types
        // import { SessionCard, UserSettings } from '@/types/study'; // Adjust path

        interface CardDisplayStatus {
          text: string;
          // Optional: add other fields like color, iconName, etc.
        }

        export function formatCardDisplayStatus(
          card: any /* Replace with SessionCard type */,
          settings: any /* Replace with UserSettings type */
        ): CardDisplayStatus {
          if (!card) return { text: '' };

          // Example Logic (adapt based on actual fields and logic in StudyFlashcardView)
          if (card.srs_level === 0 && card.learning_state === 'learning') {
            if (settings.studyAlgorithm === 'dedicated-learn' && card.internalState?.streak !== undefined) {
              return { text: `Learning - Streak: ${card.internalState.streak}/${settings.masteryThreshold}` };
            } else if (settings.studyAlgorithm === 'standard-sm2' && card.internalState?.currentStepIndex !== undefined) {
              const totalSteps = settings.initialLearningStepsMinutes?.length || 0;
              return { text: `Learning - Step: ${card.internalState.currentStepIndex + 1}/${totalSteps}` };
            }
            return { text: 'Learning' };
          }
          // Add more conditions for 'relearning', 'review' (due, not due), 'new', etc.
          // ...
          return { text: 'New Card' }; // Default or new card status
        }
        ```
    *   Thoroughly replicate and simplify the logic from `StudyFlashcardView.tsx` into this function. Make sure it's pure (doesn't modify its inputs, doesn't call hooks, etc.).

3.  **Create the Dedicated Display Component:**
    *   Create a new component file, e.g., `components/study/CardStatusIndicator.tsx`.
    *   This component will take the `card` and `settings` as props (or just the output of `formatCardDisplayStatus` if you prefer to call the formatter in the parent).
        ```typescript
        // components/study/CardStatusIndicator.tsx
        import React from 'react';
        // import { SessionCard, UserSettings } from '@/types/study'; // Adjust path
        import { formatCardDisplayStatus } from '@/lib/study/studyUiFormatters'; // Adjust path

        interface CardStatusIndicatorProps {
          card: any; // Replace with SessionCard type
          settings: any; // Replace with UserSettings type
        }

        export function CardStatusIndicator({ card, settings }: CardStatusIndicatorProps) {
          const status = formatCardDisplayStatus(card, settings);

          if (!status.text) return null;

          // You can add styling based on status.color or status.iconName if you extend CardDisplayStatus
          return (
            <div className="card-status-indicator">
              {/* Optional: <Icon name={status.iconName} /> */}
              <p>{status.text}</p>
            </div>
          );
        }
        ```

4.  **Integrate into `StudyFlashcardView.tsx`:**
    *   Import the new `CardStatusIndicator` component.
    *   Remove the old inline status calculation and display logic.
    *   Use the new component:
        ```html
        // Inside StudyFlashcardView.tsx render method
        // ...
        {currentCard && userSettings && (
          <CardStatusIndicator card={currentCard} settings={userSettings} />
        )}
        // ...
        ```
    *   You'll need to make sure `currentCard` (from `useStudySession`) and `userSettings` (from `SettingsProvider`) are available in `StudyFlashcardView`.

5.  **Test:** Check all card types and study modes to ensure the status is displayed correctly.

## 6. Clarifying Coupling between API Routes and Server Actions

**(Based on Section 3.6 of `codebase_analysis_and_recommendations.md`)**

### 6.1. Explain the Problem Simply

*   **What is the issue?**
    *   In Next.js, we have two ways to write backend code that our frontend can call:
        1.  **Server Actions:** These are functions you can call directly from your React components as if they were regular JavaScript functions. Next.js handles the communication.
        2.  **API Routes:** These are more like traditional backend endpoints (e.g., if you `fetch('/api/some-data')`).
    *   The documentation mentions that for creating decks manually, we have an API Route (`POST /api/decks/route.ts`) which *internally* calls a Server Action (`deckActions.createDeck`). This is like having a manager (API Route) who just passes on a job to a worker (Server Action) without doing much else.

*   **Why is this a problem (potentially)?**
    *   **Extra Step:** It adds an extra layer of code that might not be doing much. This can make it slightly harder to follow the code's path (debug).
    *   **Confusion:** It might be unclear why both exist for the same task. When should you use the API Route, and when the Server Action directly?

### 6.2. Explain the Solution and Core Concepts

*   **What is the suggested way to fix it?**
    *   **Analyze the Wrapper:** First, understand *why* the API Route wraps the Server Action for manual deck creation.
    *   **If the wrapper is thin (adds little value):** Consider having the client-side code call the Server Action (`deckActions.createDeck`) directly for manual deck creation. The API Route (`/api/decks`) can then be dedicated to more complex scenarios, like saving AI-generated decks (which involves receiving a list of cards, a different kind of job).
    *   **If the wrapper is essential:** If the API Route does important things *before* calling the Server Action (like special authentication checks, complex data transformation that only an API Route can do, or it's used by an external service), then it should stay. In this case, the fix is to add clear comments explaining its purpose.

*   **Core Concepts:**
    *   **Server Actions:** Designed for tight integration with React Server Components and Client Components. They simplify data mutations and form handling from the frontend. They are generally preferred for actions directly triggered by user interaction within the app.
    *   **API Routes:** More flexible for building traditional RESTful APIs, handling requests from various clients (not just your Next.js app), or when you need more control over the request/response objects (e.g., setting specific headers, handling different HTTP methods explicitly for the same URL).
    *   **Separation of Concerns:** Each piece of code should have a clear, distinct responsibility. If an API Route isn't adding unique value for a particular task, it might be an unnecessary abstraction for that task.

### 6.3. Provide a Step-by-Step Approach

1.  **Analyze `app/api/decks/route.ts`:**
    *   Read the code for this API Route carefully.
    *   Focus on the part that handles `POST` requests for **manual deck creation**.
    *   Identify what it does *before* or *after* calling `deckActions.createDeck` (the Server Action).
        *   Does it perform any special authentication/authorization checks that are different from what Server Actions usually get?
        *   Does it transform the incoming request data in a complex way?
        *   Does it handle the response differently?

2.  **Decision Point:**
    *   **Scenario A: The API Route wrapper is "thin"** (it mostly just calls the Server Action).
        1.  **Identify Client-Side Caller:** Find where in the client-side code (e.g., `app/decks/new/page.tsx` or a component it uses) the `POST /api/decks` call is made for manual deck creation.
        2.  **Modify Client-Side Code:** Change this code to import and call the `deckActions.createDeck` Server Action directly.
            ```typescript
            // Before (example in a client component/hook)
            // const response = await fetch('/api/decks', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(deckData) });

            // After
            import { createDeck } from '@/lib/actions/deckActions'; // Adjust path
            // ...
            // const newDeck = await createDeck(deckData); 
            ```
        3.  **Simplify API Route (Optional):** If `POST /api/decks` is now *only* used for AI deck creation, you can remove the manual creation logic from it, making it simpler.
    *   **Scenario B: The API Route wrapper is "essential"** (it performs necessary, unique logic).
        1.  **Add Comments:** Add detailed comments at the top of the `POST` handler in `app/api/decks/route.ts` explaining *why* it acts as a wrapper for `deckActions.createDeck` in the manual creation case. For example:
            ```typescript
            // app/api/decks/route.ts
            export async function POST(request: Request) {
              // ...
              // For manual deck creation, this route wraps the 'createDeck' Server Action 
              // primarily to [explain the reason, e.g., apply specific API middleware, 
              // handle a legacy request format, etc.].
              // For new client-side manual deck creations, consider calling 'createDeck' action directly.
              // ...
              // if (isManualCreation) {
              //   return await deckActions.createDeck(...);
              // }
              // ...
            }
            ```
        2.  **No code change to the calling pattern**, but the documentation within the code improves understanding for future developers.

3.  **Test:**
    *   If you made changes (Scenario A), thoroughly test the manual deck creation flow.
    *   Ensure AI deck creation (which might still use the API Route) also still works.
