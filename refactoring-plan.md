# Refactoring Plan & Progress

This document tracks the progress of the codebase refactoring effort aimed at improving structure, performance, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.

## Stages

### 1. Authentication System (✅ Completed)

**Goal:** Modernize and stabilize the Supabase authentication flow using server-side rendering (SSR) best practices.

**Work Done:**

- **Integrated `@supabase/ssr`:** Replaced client-only Supabase setup with `@supabase/ssr` for consistent auth state management across server and client.
- **Implemented Middleware:** Added `middleware.ts` to handle session cookie refresh and management.
- **Refactored Hooks:**
    - `hooks/use-supabase.tsx`: Updated to use `createBrowserClient`.
    - `hooks/use-auth.tsx`: Updated to use the SSR-compatible client, improved error handling (including removing the Strict Mode `effectRan` check and fixing the `signOut` syntax error), refined `signIn` logic (removed forced navigation), and added comprehensive JSDoc documentation.
- **Created Server-Side Callback:** Replaced the client-side `app/auth/callback/page.tsx` with a server-side Route Handler (`app/auth/callback/route.ts`) using `createSupabaseServerClient` to securely handle email confirmation code exchange.
- **Improved User Feedback:** Updated `app/login/page.tsx` and `app/signup/page.tsx` to handle redirects reactively based on auth state, provide clearer loading states, and display specific feedback messages (using toasts) derived from the auth callback redirects.
- **Error Handling:** Refined error handling in `signIn` to prevent the Next.js error overlay for expected errors like invalid credentials, while still providing user feedback via toasts.
- **Cleanup:** Removed redundant `app/auth/error/` directory and client-side callback page.
- **Documentation:** Updated `docs/project-documentation.md` and `README.md` to reflect the new authentication setup.
- **Version Control:** Changes committed and pushed to the `refactor/auth` branch.

### 2. Data Services (`lib/`) (⏳ In Progress)

**Goal:** Refactor core data interaction logic (e.g., for decks, cards, settings) to ensure type safety, robustness, efficiency, and adherence to SOLID principles.

**Work Done:**

- **Refactored `lib/deckService.ts`:**
    - Overhauled all CRUD functions (`fetchDecks`, `createDeckService`, `getDeckService`, `updateDeckService`, `deleteDeckService`).
    - Standardized return signatures to `Promise<{ data: T | null; error: PostgrestError | CustomError | null }>`, replacing direct returns or thrown errors.
    - Implemented structured error handling and logging within each service function.
    - Enhanced type safety using interfaces (`RawDeckQueryResult`, `RawCardQueryResult`, `CreateDeckParams`) and Supabase `.returns<T>()`.
    - Correctly handled `Date` object transformations (`lastStudied`) between database strings and frontend state.
    - Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation, including warnings about lack of atomicity in `updateDeckService` and `deleteDeckService`.
    - Explicitly deleted cards before deck deletion in `deleteDeckService`.
- **Updated Consumers of `deckService`:**
    - **`hooks/use-decks.tsx`:** Refactored all function calls (`loadDecks`, `createDeck`, `getDeck`, `updateDeck`, `deleteDeck`) to correctly handle the new `{ data, error }` return structure and manage loading/error states.
    - **`lib/localStorageUtils.ts`:** Fixed `getDecksFromLocalStorage` to correctly parse stored ISO date strings (`lastStudied`) back into `Date` objects.
    - **`types/deck.ts`:** Updated `FlashCard` interface to define `lastStudied` as `Date | null`.
    - **`app/study/[deckId]/page.tsx`:** Significantly refactored `handleAnswer` to correctly:
        - Handle the `Date` object for `lastStudied`.
        - Call `calculateDifficultyScore` with the appropriate arguments.
        - Restore and fix the study session logic (mastery checks, card filtering, next index calculation) to prevent premature completion messages.
        - Update the `studyCards` state immediately to reflect visual changes (like difficulty score) without waiting for a full cycle.
    - **`components/deck-list.tsx`:** Corrected the progress bar calculation and text to accurately reflect card mastery using `calculateMasteredCount` instead of relying on potentially incorrect `deck.progress` fields.
- **Version Control:** Changes committed and pushed to the `refactor/data-layer` branch (renamed from `refactor/auth`).

- **Refactored `lib/settingsService.ts`:**
    - Standardized return signatures to `Promise<{ data: Settings | null; error: PostgrestError | null }>`.
    - Implemented structured error handling.
    - Enhanced type safety using `RawSettingsQueryResult` interface and `.returns<T>()`.
    - Validated `cardFont` during transformation.
    - Added/updated JSDoc documentation.

**Next Steps:**

- **Review Other `lib/` Utilities:** Assess `study-utils.ts`, `cardDifficultyUtils.ts` (if exists), `fonts.ts`, etc., for clarity, efficiency, and documentation.

### 3. State Management (`providers/`, `hooks/`)

**Goal:** Review and potentially refactor global/feature-specific state management.

**Planned Steps:**

- **Review `providers/SettingsProvider.tsx`:** Understand how settings are fetched, stored, and updated. Ensure efficient context usage and minimize unnecessary re-renders.
- **Review Custom Hooks:** Examine hooks like `useDecks`, `useStudy` (as mentioned in `project-documentation.md`) if they exist, ensuring they manage state effectively and encapsulate logic cleanly.

### 4. API Routes (`app/api/`)

**Goal:** Ensure backend API routes are secure, efficient, well-structured, and handle errors gracefully.

**Planned Steps:**

- **Review Existing Routes:** Analyze routes mentioned in documentation (TTS, Deck Management) or found in the directory.
- **Authentication/Authorization:** Verify that routes correctly use the Supabase server client (from `lib/supabase/server.ts` or similar) to check user authentication and apply necessary authorization logic (e.g., checking if the user owns the deck they're trying to modify).
- **Input Validation:** Ensure robust input validation (e.g., using Zod) is applied to request bodies/parameters.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error responses.
- **Structure:** Ensure clear separation of concerns within API route handlers.

### 5. Core UI Components (`components/`)

**Goal:** Improve reusability, maintainability, and performance of key UI components.

**Planned Steps:**

- **Review `DeckList`:** Analyze props, data fetching/display logic, and potential optimizations.
- **Review `Header`:** Check for clarity, state dependencies, and responsiveness.
- **Review Other Shared Components:** Assess general component structure, prop types, styling encapsulation, and documentation.

### 6. Testing (`__tests__/`)

**Goal:** Ensure adequate test coverage and improve test quality.

**Planned Steps:**

- **Review Existing Tests:** Assess current unit/integration tests for clarity, coverage, and correctness.
- **Add Tests for Refactored Code:** Write tests specifically for the refactored authentication logic and data services.
- **Improve Test Setup:** Review `jest.config.js` and `jest.setup.js` for potential improvements.

### 7. Final Documentation Update

**Goal:** Ensure all documentation (`README.md`, `docs/`) is fully up-to-date after all refactoring stages.

**Planned Steps:**

- Review all modified sections.
- Add any missing documentation for new patterns or components.
