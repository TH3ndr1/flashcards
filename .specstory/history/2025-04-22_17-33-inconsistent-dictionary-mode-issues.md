# Inconsistent Dictionary Mode Issues (2025-04-22 19:33:53)

_**User**_

I notice than the mode that is returned is sometimes in correct. Example dictonary pages french-dutch are sometimes returned as knowledge-based text. How is this possible?

Okay, I understand. It seems the logic determining whether a flashcard pair represents a "translation" (Mode 1) or "knowledge-based" (Mode 2) might be misfiring, especially after the AI generates the content.

Looking at the `generateFlashcardsFromText` function, specifically the part where `cardsWithLanguageInfo` is created (around lines 470-501), there's a helper function `isTranslationMode` that uses heuristics (like word count and the presence of two detected languages *before* the AI call) to guess the mode for *each individual card* after the AI has already generated them.

This post-generation check can be problematic:

1.  **Heuristics can be wrong:** A short knowledge-based question might accidentally match the "translation" pattern, or a complex vocabulary entry might fail it.
2.  **AI might follow instructions:** The AI is explicitly asked in the prompt to determine the mode and format accordingly. This post-processing check might override the AI's potentially correct formatting based on its understanding of the document type.
3.  **Language Swapping:** If `isTranslationMode` evaluates to `true`, the code swaps the `questionLanguage` and `answerLanguage`. This assumes the AI *always* puts the source language in the "question" field for translations, which isn't guaranteed.

A more robust approach would be to rely more on the initial language detection (`languageInfo`) performed *before* calling the AI. If two distinct languages were detected (`languageInfo.isBilingual === true`), we can assume the AI was intended to operate in Mode 1 (Translation) for that file. If only one language was detected, we assume Mode 2 (Knowledge-Based).

Let's simplify the logic that assigns language information *after* the AI response. We'll remove the per-card `isTranslationMode` heuristic check and instead use the overall `languageInfo.isBilingual` status determined earlier.

I'll read the relevant section and apply this change.

Okay, I have the relevant code section. I will now replace the per-card heuristic check (`isTranslationMode`) with logic that assigns languages based on the `languageInfo.isBilingual` flag determined before the AI call.

Specifically, I will:

1.  Remove the `isTranslationMode` inner function definition (lines 474-489).
2.  Replace the `if (isTranslationMode(card))` block (lines 491-509) with a simpler conditional check on `languageInfo.isBilingual`.
3.  If `languageInfo.isBilingual` is true, assign `languageInfo.questionLanguage` and `languageInfo.answerLanguage` to the card's `questionLanguage` and `answerLanguage` respectively, and set `isBilingual` to `true`. *Correction:* Based on the prompt, for Mode 1 (translation), the `question` field should contain the source language word and `answer` the target language word. If `detectLanguages` identifies, say, French (primary/question) and Dutch (secondary/answer), the card should reflect this. The original swapping logic might have been trying to correct for an AI mistake, but let's trust the initial detection for now. So, `questionLanguage` will be `languageInfo.questionLanguage` and `answerLanguage` will be `languageInfo.answerLanguage`.
4.  If `languageInfo.isBilingual` is false, assign the single detected language (`languageInfo.questionLanguage` or `languageInfo.answerLanguage`, whichever is available) to both `questionLanguage` and `answerLanguage`, and set `isBilingual` to `false`.

This should make the language assignment more consistent with the overall detected languages for the file.

```

I've updated the code to assign language information based on the `languageInfo.isBilingual` flag determined before calling the AI, removing the previous heuristic check.

This should lead to more consistent language tagging for the flashcards, aligning better with the overall language(s) detected in the source document. If two languages were detected initially, all cards from that file will be marked as bilingual with the respective languages assigned. If only one was detected, all cards will be marked as monolingual in that language.

Let me know if you'd like to explore further refinements, such as adjusting the AI prompt itself.

I want to take a different approach. The google gemini 2.0 flash model allows for structured output in json.
Please read this document: @https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/control-generated-output?_gl=1*a2lj3h*_ga*NDg4MjA1MDU0LjE3Mzg0OTY4NDM.*_ga_WH2QY8WWF5*MTc0NTM0MjY2MS4xMi4xLjE3NDUzNDMxODEuNDEuMC4w 
Then write me the structured json output for our use case
Then write me the updated prompt that allows for the structured json output

Okay, that's an excellent approach. Using Gemini's structured output feature should significantly improve the reliability of identifying the document type and assigning the correct languages. By defining a specific JSON schema, we instruct the model to return the data in a predictable format, reducing the need for potentially brittle post-processing heuristics.

Based on the documentation [Control generated output](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/control-generated-output?_gl=1*a2lj3h*_ga*NDg4MjA1MDU0LjE3Mzg0OTY4NDM.*_ga_WH2QY8WWF5*MTc0NTM0MjY2MS4xMi4xLjE3NDUzNDMxODEuNDEuMC4w) and our use case, here's the plan:

1.  **Define the JSON Schema:** We'll create a schema that the Gemini model must adhere to. This schema will explicitly include the mode (`translation` or `knowledge`) and the list of flashcards, each with its question, answer, and associated languages.
2.  **Update the Prompt:** We'll revise the prompt to instruct the model to analyze the text, determine the mode, generate flashcards accordingly, and format the *entire output* according to the provided JSON schema.
3.  **Modify the `generateContent` Call:** We'll update the call to the Vertex AI SDK to include the `generationConfig` specifying `responseMimeType: 'application/json'` and the `responseSchema`.
4.  **Adjust Parsing Logic:** We'll simplify the code that processes the model's response, as we can now expect a well-structured JSON object instead of needing to extract JSON from potentially unstructured text.

***

### 1. Structured JSON Output Schema

Here is the JSON schema definition tailored for our flashcard generation task. This structure will be passed to the model. Note that this is the JavaScript object representation of the schema as required by the `@google-cloud/vertexai` library:

```typescript
const flashcardSchema = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    mode: {
      type: 'string',
      enum: ['translation', 'knowledge'],
      description: "The mode determined for the document: 'translation' for vocabulary lists (e.g., word pairs like 'word1 - word2'), 'knowledge' for regular prose or factual text."
    },
    detectedQuestionLanguage: {
        type: 'string',
        description: "The primary language detected for questions or source words (e.g., 'English', 'French')."
    },
    detectedAnswerLanguage: {
        type: 'string',
        description: "The secondary/target language detected for answers or translations (e.g., 'Dutch', 'Spanish'). Should be the same as detectedQuestionLanguage for 'knowledge' mode."
    },
    flashcards: {
      type: 'array',
      description: "An array of generated flashcard objects.",
      items: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          question: {
            type: 'string',
            description: "The question or source word/phrase for the flashcard."
          },
          answer: {
            type: 'string',
            description: "The answer or target word/phrase/translation for the flashcard. Should be concise for knowledge mode (under 100 words)."
          }
          // We will add language info *after* generation based on the top-level detected languages
        },
        required: ['question', 'answer']
      }
    }
  },
  required: ['mode', 'detectedQuestionLanguage', 'detectedAnswerLanguage', 'flashcards']
};
```

*Self-Correction:* Initially, I considered putting language fields *inside* each flashcard item in the schema. However, it's more efficient and reliable to have the model determine the overall languages for the document (`detectedQuestionLanguage`, `detectedAnswerLanguage`) at the top level. We can then apply these languages to *all* generated cards during post-processing, simplifying the model's task and ensuring consistency.

### 2. Updated Prompt for Structured Output

This revised prompt incorporates the instructions for using the schema and provides clear examples matching the schema structure.

```text
Analyze the following text extracted from the document titled "${filename}". Your goal is to generate flashcards based on the content and output the result as a JSON object conforming EXACTLY to the provided schema.

Input Text:
"""
${truncatedText}
"""

JSON Schema for Output:
\`\`\`json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "mode": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["translation", "knowledge"],
      "description": "The mode determined for the document: 'translation' for vocabulary lists (e.g., word pairs like 'word1 - word2'), 'knowledge' for regular prose or factual text."
    },
    "detectedQuestionLanguage": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The primary language detected for questions or source words (e.g., 'English', 'French')."
    },
    "detectedAnswerLanguage": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The secondary/target language detected for answers or translations (e.g., 'Dutch', 'Spanish'). Should be the same as detectedQuestionLanguage for 'knowledge' mode."
    },
    "flashcards": {
      "type": "array",
      "description": "An array of generated flashcard objects.",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "question": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The question or source word/phrase for the flashcard."
          },
          "answer": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The answer or target word/phrase/translation for the flashcard. Should be concise for knowledge mode (under 100 words)."
          }
        },
        "required": ["question", "answer"]
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["mode", "detectedQuestionLanguage", "detectedAnswerLanguage", "flashcards"]
}
\`\`\`

Instructions:

1.  **Determine Document Mode & Languages:**
    *   Analyze the text to identify if it's primarily a 'translation' vocabulary list (pairs of words/phrases, often separated by '-', '=', or on separate lines) or 'knowledge'-based text (prose, explanations, facts).
    *   Detect the primary language (for questions/source words) and the secondary/target language (for answers/translations).
    *   If the mode is 'knowledge', `detectedAnswerLanguage` should be the same as `detectedQuestionLanguage`.
    *   Use full language names (e.g., 'English', 'French', 'Dutch').
    *   *Hints:* ${languageInfo.questionLanguage ? `Initial analysis suggests the primary language might be ${languageInfo.questionLanguage}.` : ''} ${languageInfo.answerLanguage && languageInfo.answerLanguage !== languageInfo.questionLanguage ? `Initial analysis suggests a secondary language might be ${languageInfo.answerLanguage}.` : ''}

2.  **Generate Flashcards based on Mode:**
    *   **If mode is 'translation':** Create one flashcard per word/phrase pair. The `question` should be the source term, and the `answer` should be the target term.
    *   **If mode is 'knowledge':** Create meaningful question-answer pairs (at least two, ideally more if content allows) that test understanding of the text. Keep answers concise (under 100 words). Questions and answers should be in the `detectedQuestionLanguage`.

3.  **Format Output:** Return *only* a single JSON object matching the schema above. Do not include any text before or after the JSON object.

Example Output (Translation Mode):
\`\`\`json
{
  "mode": "translation",
  "detectedQuestionLanguage": "German",
  "detectedAnswerLanguage": "English",
  "flashcards": [
    { "question": "Tafel", "answer": "Table" },
    { "question": "Stuhl", "answer": "Chair" }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

Example Output (Knowledge Mode):
\`\`\`json
{
  "mode": "knowledge",
  "detectedQuestionLanguage": "English",
  "detectedAnswerLanguage": "English",
  "flashcards": [
    { "question": "What is the main function of photosynthesis?", "answer": "Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose, using water and carbon dioxide." },
    { "question": "How does chlorophyll contribute to photosynthesis?", "answer": "Chlorophyll absorbs light energy, which is then used to drive the chemical reactions of photosynthesis." }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

Generate the JSON output now based on the provided text.
```

***

Next, I will modify the `generateFlashcardsFromText` function in `app/api/extract-pdf/route.ts` to use this new schema, prompt, and adjust the response handling.
