# Improving Card Flip Animation (2025-03-28 14:34:00)

_**User**_

When moving to a next card, the card turns, but I can very briefly, during the duration of the turning motion event, see already de answer of the next card before the question is shown.

Can't you just first turn the page and than, when the page is approcimatly 50% turned, change the content?

_**Assistant**_

I understand the issue - during the card flip animation, you're seeing a glimpse of the next card's answer before the question appears, which isn't ideal for a flashcard application. Let's improve this by implementing a content switch halfway through the animation.

First, let me search for any relevant card-related components:

Let me update the CSS to make the fade transitions much faster:

```diff
  .flip-card-inner {
    transition: transform 0.6s;
    transform-style: preserve-3d;
  }
  
  .flip-card-front,
  .flip-card-back {
    backface-visibility: hidden;
  }
  
  .card-is-changing .flip-card-content {
    opacity: 0;
-   transition: opacity 0.15s;
+   transition: opacity 0.05s;
  }
  
  .flip-card-content {
    opacity: 1;
-   transition: opacity 0.15s;
+   transition: opacity 0.05s;
  }
```

Now the content will:
1. Fade out/in much more quickly (50ms instead of 150ms)
2. Still maintain the smooth 0.6s card flip animation
3. Have almost instant content changes while preserving the 3D flip effect

The fade will now be barely noticeable but still prevent any content flash, while the card flip animation remains smooth and satisfying. Let me know if you'd like the fade to be even faster or if you'd like any other adjustments!

For me it has nothing to do with the timings of the fades or rotations. The root cause is that a new card is loaded as soon as the user has clicked on the "corrcect" or "incorrect" button. 

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, now I understand the core issue! You're absolutely right. The problem is that we're updating the card content immediately when the user clicks the button, rather than waiting until the card is mid-flip to change the content. This is why you see the flash of the next card's content during the flip animation.

Let's fix this by:
1. Starting the flip animation first
2. Waiting until the card is approximately halfway through its rotation (when it's not visible to the user)
3. Only then updating the card content

Here's how we'll modify the code:

```diff
    const handleAnswer = useCallback(
      async (correct: boolean) => {
        if (!deck || !studyCards.length) return
        
        setIsTransitioning(true)
+       // First start the flip back animation
+       setIsFlipped(false)
+       
+       // Wait until card is halfway through the flip (when it's not visible) before updating content
+       await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 300))
        
        const updatedCards = [...deck.cards]
        const currentCard = studyCards[currentCardIndex]
        if (!currentCard) return

        const cardIndex = updatedCards.findIndex((c) => c.id === currentCard.id)
        
        // Update card counts and progress...
        if (cardIndex !== -1) {
          // ... existing card update logic ...
        }

        // Determine next card index
        let nextIndex = currentCardIndex
        if (cardIndex !== -1 && updatedCards[cardIndex].correctCount >= MASTERY_THRESHOLD) {
          const updatedStudyCards = studyCards.filter(card => card.id !== currentCard.id)
          setStudyCards(updatedStudyCards)
          
          if (updatedStudyCards.length === 0) {
            setIsTransitioning(false)
            return
          }
          
          nextIndex = currentCardIndex >= updatedStudyCards.length ? 0 : currentCardIndex
        } else {
          const availableIndices = studyCards
            .map((_, index) => index)
            .filter(index => index !== currentCardIndex)

          if (correct && availableIndices.length > 0) {
            nextIndex = availableIndices[Math.floor(Math.random() * availableIndices.length)]
          } else {
            nextIndex = currentCardIndex < studyCards.length - 1 ? currentCardIndex + 1 : 0
          }
        }

        // Update the current card index
        setCurrentCardIndex(nextIndex)
        
+       // Wait for the flip animation to complete
+       await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 300))
        setIsTransitioning(false)

        // Save progress to the database
        try {
          await updateDeck(updatedDeck)
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("Error updating deck:", error)
          toast({
            title: "Error saving progress",
            description: "There was a problem saving your progress.",
            variant: "destructive",
          })
        }
      },
      [deck, studyCards, currentCardIndex, updateDeck, toast]
    )
```

The key changes are:
1. We start by triggering the flip animation first (`setIsFlipped(false)`)
2. We wait 300ms (half of the 600ms flip animation) before updating any content
3. We update the card content when the card is perpendicular to the user's view (when they can't see either side)
4. We wait for the remaining 300ms of the animation before clearing the transition state

This should completely fix the issue because:
1. The user won't see any content changes during the flip since we only update when the card is "edge-on"
2. The timing is based on the actual flip animation rather than trying to fade content in/out
3. We maintain the smooth 3D flip effect while ensuring clean content transitions

Would you like me to implement this change? We can also adjust the timing if the 300ms (half of the flip duration) needs to be tweaked.

can you implement the above?

I'll implement the solution by editing the necessary files:

      [deck, studyCards, currentCardIndex, updateDeck, toast]
```

I've updated the `handleAnswer` function with the new implementation that:

1. Starts by triggering the flip animation (`setIsFlipped(false)`)
2. Waits 300ms (half of the flip duration) before updating any content
3. Updates all the card data and progress while the card is "edge-on"
4. Sets the new card index
5. Waits another 300ms for the flip to complete before clearing the transition state

The key timing sequence is now:
